# #numbers practice

# Days_in_Feb = 28 

# # this formula will not work cause the number is an strings 
# # print (Days_in_Feb + "Days in February")
# #this will display an error 

# print (str(Days_in_Feb)+ " Days in february")

# # the str funtion needs to be added


# #this is other example about working with numbers 

# #first_num = '5'
# #second_num = '6'
# #print (first_num + second_num)

# #first_num = input ('Enter fist number: ')
# #second_num= input ('Enter second number: ')
# #Print (first_num + second_num)

# #this will print jus 56 because the numbers are just strings


# first_num = input ('Enter fist number: ')
# second_num= input ('Enter second number: ')
# print (int(first_num) + int(second_num))
# print (float(first_num) + float(second_num))


# #this formula will show the right information treating the number as a number with adition operation 
# #this operation is including the ' ' for strings because if we don't use them will be jus numbers

# first_num = 5
# second_num = 6
# print (first_num + second_num)

# #this will print 11 string

# number = 7
# print(f"The number is {number}.")


# color = 'blue'
# animal = 'horse'

# # You can add, or concatenate, two strings together with +:
# print(color + animal)
# # This displays: bluehorse

# # You can add many strings together, whether the strings are variables or directly in
# # the quotation marks:
# print(color + ' ' + animal + '!')
# # This displays: blue horse!

# # You can also save the result into a new string variable:
# combined_words = color + ' ' + animal + '!'
# print(combined_words)



# boys_count = 10
# girls_count = 12

# # Add two numbers together using the + operator:
# print(boys_count + girls_count)
# # This displays: 22

# # You can save the result in a new variable to use later:
# total_count = boys_count + girls_count
# print(total_count)

dolls = 5

print("There are " + dolls + " dolls")
